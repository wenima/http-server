I think he's more concerned about the time wasted by programmers (presumably coming from other languages) where the 'self' parameter doesn't need to be specified, and who occasionally forget it (even though they know better -- habit is a powerful force). It's true that omitting 'self' from the parameter list tends to lead to more obscure error messages than forgetting to type 'self.' in front of an instance variable or method reference. Perhaps even worse (as Bruce mentions) is the error message you get when the method is declared correctly but the call has the wrong number of arguments, like in this example given by Bruce: Let me first bring up a few typical arguments that are brought in against Bruce's proposal.

There's a pretty good argument to make that requiring explicit 'self' in the parameter list reinforces the theoretical equivalency between these two ways of calling a method, given """
